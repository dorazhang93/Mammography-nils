# Implementation for Mammogram DL pipelines
In this folder, we implemented mammography DL pipelines under the open-mmlab MMPreTrain framework. This work is published and is available at XXXX
## Deep learning on routine full-breast mammograms enhances lymph node metastasis prediction in early breast cancer
In this study, we developed and validated DL models based on preoperatively available clinicopathological predictors and full-breast digital mammogram features to predict LNM status and comprehensively evaluated the added value of routine mammograms to preoperatively predict LNM in multicenter cohorts of cN0 T1â€“T2 breast cancer patients having primary surgery. The results demonstrate that advances in DL techniques, including domain-adaptive pretraining through SSL and sophisticated spatial modeling empowered by a Transformer, significantly improve imaging analysis, particularly for full-breast mammograms. Our findings reveal that routine mammograms can substantially enhance the preoperative diagnosis of LNM in early-stage breast cancer, and are as informative as key postoperative pathological indicators, such as tumor size and multifocality. Notably, full-breast mammograms exhibited overall comparable predictive performance to tumor region-focused models and showed favorable discriminating ability in the independent test set, underscoring its clinical applicability.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps

### Prerequisites

python 3.8.18, check environment.yml for list of needed packages

### Installation

1.Clone the repo

```git clone https://github.com/dorazhang93/Mammography-nils.git```

2.Create conda environment

```conda env create --name VIR_ENV_NAME --file=environment.yml --force```

## Usage

### 1.Activate the created conda environment

```conda activate VIR_ENV_NAME```

```cd Mammography-nils```

### 2.Data preprocessing
Prepare unlabeled mammogram patches for self-supervised learning and single- or multi-task labeled mammogram ROIs or full-breast mammograms for supervised learning. Detailed preprocessing steps is available in the publication.
Dataloader API reused the open mmlab design with minor changes. Source code is under the folder -- dataset/

### 3. Self-supervised training of unlabeled mammogram patches
Configuration files for the three state-of-the-art SSL algorithms were placed under the folder -- configs/pretrain

An example to run the BarlowTwins algorithm using 2 GPUs with mixed-precsion mode for efficient training :
bash tools/dist_train.sh configs/pretrain/barlowtwins_resnet50-exp2_-coslr-100e_MMpatches.py 2 --amp > barlowtwins.log

### 4. Supervised training of labeled mammograms

Configuration files for supervised training on multi-task mammograms of full-breast and ROIs were given under the folder configs/multi_task_SL.

An example to run SL on full-breast images using Transformer neck and ResNet backbone pretrained with BarlowTwins SSL:
python projects/Mammography/tools/train.py projects/Mammography/configs/multi_task_SL/fullimage1792x1024_resnet50-expan2_barlowtwin_finetune_transformer_Aug3.py \
      --work-dir ${out_dir} \
      --cfg-options default_hooks.checkpoint.out_dir=${ckpt_dir} \
      train_dataloader.dataset.data_root=${data_root} \
      val_dataloader.dataset.data_root=${data_root} \
      test_dataloader.dataset.data_root=${data_root} \
      train_dataloader.dataset.ann_file=${anno_subfolder}/train.json \
      val_dataloader.dataset.ann_file=${anno_subfolder}/val.json \
      test_dataloader.dataset.ann_file=${anno_subfolder}/meta/test.json

To evaluate above trained model:
python tools/test.py ${out_dir}/${EXP}.py ${best_ckpt} --work-dir work_dirs_test/ --out ${out_dir}/test/best_rd${r2}.json --out-item metrics

To run mammogram features using above trained model:
python tools/test.py ${out_dir}/${EXP}.py ${best_ckpt} --work-dir work_dirs_test/ --out ${out_dir}/test/best_rd${r2}.pkl --out-item pred

### 5. Combining mammogram features and clinical variables

python projects/Mammography/mlp.py --data-root ${data_root} --mode "clinical-mammo" \
          --work-dir ${out_dir} >${out_dir}/out.log
